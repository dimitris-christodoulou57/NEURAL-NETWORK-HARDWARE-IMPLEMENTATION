NEURAL NETWORK

In this project, nodes from the 3 layers (input, hidden and output layer) are implemented. Using these nodes, someone can generate more complicate network to satisfy the requirements of a specific problem. Additionally, each node can use different activation functions, which are implemented, to achieve more accurate networks.

The project is developed on ISE Design Suite, using Verilog language.
